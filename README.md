# 3D-Crossy-Road
## 3D Road-Crossing Game
This game was a project I worked on during a 1-2 week period during the summer in 2020. It is inspired by the mobile game Crossy Road. For the most part, I used downloaded open source prefabs for the models because I didn't have the time to do all the 3D modeling. Besides the 3D modeling, however, the rest is my work (scripting, etc.). To start the game properly, start the "menu" scene (which starts on a settings page) and press "back" to go to the main menu. From here you can play the game, read about controls, or change mouse sensitivity in settings. Alternatively you can just open the "Game" scene and start there.

### Menu
The menu scene starts in the settings page and you need to press back to find the main menu. It used to start on the main menu but when I was doing some work on it later, I changed it to initialize to the settings page and I never switched it back. In the "Settings" page you can change the mouse sensitivity. In the "Help" page you can read about how to play the game and controls. The "Play" button starts the game for you.

### Gameplay
You play as a small animal in a forest that needs to make it back home to your family. In your way, however are a bunch of roads with a lot of cars. In the distance you can see a moving arrow that points you to the end (home). If you get hit by a car the game is over (you are taking to the game lost page) and if you make it home safe you reach the game win page.


### Controls
The WASD keys are used to move forward, left, right, and back. 
The mouse is used to control the direction you are going.
Space allows you to jump.
